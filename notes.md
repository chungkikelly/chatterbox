### WTF?

+ Must stringify functions to deal with them in JSON (loginForm)
+ Joining 'general' in the function `loginUser` doesn't work, but it will upon connection?
  + **SOLUTION**: we replaced socket.id (which is an attribute they use to see who's in what room)


### TODO

+ channel / user search
<!-- + create private messaging -->
+ add new messages notification + option
+ sending different file types
+ message infinite scrolling
